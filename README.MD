# Oxide
Oxide is a generic Discord bot mainly created for personal uses.

## Using this bot
This code here purely exists so others can contribute. I do not intend to make this bot a
self hostable bot yet nor do I plan to do so anytime in future. If you want to self host,
bear in mind that you will not get any support regarding that on this repository or relevant
Discord servers.

The bot is currently under active development and is restricted to limited usage only. If you
would like to use or test this bot, Contact izxxr#3195 on Discord.

## Contributing
The bot is open to contributions. Feel free to fix bugs and implement new features. For major
changes, you might want to discuss it prior to making changes. Contact izxxr#3195 on
Discord for more info.
